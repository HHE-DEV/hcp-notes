# Use Events to Block Time Off on Schedule

Click on the `+New` at the top, then `+Event` to mark time off on the schedule
for either employee time off, a meeting, etc.

You can optionally add a location, for a meeting for example.  You can change
the employees / team associated with the event when you go to schedule it.
