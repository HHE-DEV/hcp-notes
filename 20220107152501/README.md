Most of the items in the `Installation` categories need to be added twice, if
they are also an item that can be sold as a standalone service.

1. Add item to the appropriate category.
  1. [Here is an explanation of the top level categories](https://github.com/HHE-DEV/hcp-notes/tree/main/20220107145521)
1. Add the service name and description
  1. The descriptions we want to be consistent and fairly in-depth as these
     typically show up on the invoice or estimate.
1. Add an image of the item.
  1. Because these items are typically used in estimates, having in image makes
     the estimates look much more professional.
1. In the `Labor Rates` section, select `Lead Installer` and add the appropriate
   number of hours for the service.
  1. Also add the `Lead Helper` if it's applicable for the service.
1. Add any material / material packages to the service.
  1. Note unless the service only has possible piece of equipment then it can
     be added to the materials, however this is generally not the case.
  1. Equipment is typically added to the `Materials` section of an estimate
     separately, which allows the install services to be more generic.
1. Toggle on the `Calculated price` toggle on the right for the service cost
   to automatically be calculated.
