# Use Templates in Sales Proposals

When creating a sales proposal it is preferred to start with one of the templates that have been created.  The
created templates should have the appropriate wording / descriptions in them for the given type of work, however the
service items may need to be updated / adjusted.  It is ***important*** that ***before*** deleting an item that you first
add your new item to the proposal so that any wording / description can be copied to the item that you added.

If you have to create a sales proposal from scratch, because a template does not yet exist for that type of service /
proposal then, you should consider saving those items as templates as well for future use.
