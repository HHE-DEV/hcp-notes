# Create Images to Use in Proposals or Price Book

The images for the price book and proposals were created using [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com). The
[template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAExyLPA7_M/share/preview?token=21Y_IEgqIm6PCbQAZL57aw&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAExyLPA7_M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
is a good starting point if new images are needed, so that a similar general theme can be used. The colors listed
below should also be used for background colors to remain consistent.

## Colors Used in Images
1. Gold: #FFD700
1. Platinum: #E5E4E2
1. Bronze: #CD7F32
1. Silver: #C0C0C0

The template also includes a bunch of equipment images that have already been uploaded to help to create your new
image.
