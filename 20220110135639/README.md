# Use Property Profile to Retire Equipment

When a piece of equipment is being replaced, then we need to `retire` the
existing equipment in the `property profile`.  We do not want to delete it.
Add `Retired` to the display name, as well as including the date it was
retired in the `notes` section of the `property profile`.
