# Use a Mock Account to Practice

If you are trying to learn something or want to try something out you can
create a mock account or use the already created mock account named
`Testy McTestFace`.  Just make sure that the account has the `Mock` tag and
any jobs also have the `Mock` tag, so that they can periodically be removed.
