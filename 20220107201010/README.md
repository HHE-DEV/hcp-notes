# Use Arrow Icon to View Invoice on Mobile

When on mobile it is difficult to find the invoice / work-order number.  Using
the arrows icon on the `Line Items` sections pulls up a view of the invoice
that is better suited for sharing / explaining the items to the customer as
well as reveals the invoice / work-order number.
